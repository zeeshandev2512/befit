                <h3>gym for men</h3>
                <p>At-home workout routine for men
                  Whether you’re a seasoned expert or new to strength training, working out at home is a great option when you can’t get to the gym or need a change of pace.
                    
                    The at-home workouts below require a limited amount of equipment. Plus, some of the movements can be substituted for bodyweight exercises in which you use your body’s own weight as resistance.
                    
                    These exercises can serve as a weeklong beginner routine or be cycled to provide several sessions per week for advanced trainees.
                    
                    If your goal is weight loss, you can add a form of cardio, such as running or cycling, between sessions.
                    
                    Equipment required: flat weight bench, appropriate adjustable dumbbells based on your level of experience
                    
                    If you’re just starting out, you may want to visit a specialty store to get expert advice on selecting the right equipment. But if you know what you’re looking for, you can purchase adjustable dumbbells online.
                    
                    Rest intervals: 60–90 seconds

                <h3>gym for women</h3>
                <p>Getting started
                    
                    Arm exercises
                    1. Dumbbell curls
                    Targets: biceps
                    
                    Stand or sit with a dumbbell in each hand, arms at your side, feet shoulder-width apart.
                    Keep your elbows close to your torso and rotate the dumbbells so the palms of your hands are facing your body. This is your starting position.
                    Take a deep breath and when you exhale, curl the weights upward while contracting your biceps.
                    Pause at the top of the curl, then lower to the starting position.
                    Repeat 10 to 15 times. Perform 2 to 3 sets.
                
                    2. Triceps dip
                    Targets: triceps and shoulders
                    Sit on a sturdy chair. Place your arms at your sides and your feet flat on the floor.
                    Place your palms facing down beside your hips and grip the front of the seat.
                    Move your body off the chair while gripping the seat. Knees should be slightly bent and your glutes should hover over the floor. Your arms should be fully extended, supporting your weight.
                    Inhale and lower your body until your elbows form a 90-degree angle.
                    Pause at the bottom, exhale, then push your body up to the starting position, squeezing your triceps at the top.
                    Repeat 10 to 15 times. Perform 2 to 3 sets

                    3. Chest press
                    Targets: chest, shoulders, triceps
                    
                    Lie down on an exercise mat with knees bent and a light dumbbell in each hand. You can also do this exercise on a bench.
                    Extend elbows to a 90-degree position with the back of your arms resting on the floor. The dumbbells should be over your chest.
                    Take a deep breath and when you exhale, extend your arms up until the dumbbells almost touch.
                    Pause, then return to the starting position.
                    Repeat 10 to 15 times. Perform 2 to 3 sets.
                   
                    
                    Shoulder exercises
                    4. Dumbbell front raise
                    Targets: shoulders, specifically the anterior deltoid muscles
                    
                    Grasp a light dumbbell in each hand.
                    Position the dumbbells in front of your upper legs with your elbows straight or slightly bent.
                    Raise dumbbells forward and upward until upper arms are above horizontal.
                    Lower to the starting position.
                    Repeat 10 to 15 times. Perform 3 sets.
                   

                    Safety tips

                    Warm up and cool down. Warming up before doing any resistance workout not only gets your body ready for exercise, it also reduces your risk of injury. Spend at least 5 to 8 minutes engaging in some form of cardio or dynamic stretches. When you’ve finished your workout, take some time to cool down and stretch.
                    Focus on your form. When you first start a particular workout routine, Miller says your focus should be on your form or technique. Then, as you build confidence, endurance, and strength, you can begin to increase the weight or do more sets.
                    Engage your core. Each exercise listed above requires core strength to support your lower back. To stay safe, make sure you engage your abdominal muscles before executing any move and keep them engaged throughout the exercise.
                    Stop if you feel pain. Upper body exercises will challenge your muscles and may leave you slightly sore, but you shouldn’t feel pain. If you do, stop and assess the problem. If the discomfort is caused by improper form, consider working with a personal trainer. If your pain persists even after correcting your form, follow up with your doctor or physical therapist.</p>
